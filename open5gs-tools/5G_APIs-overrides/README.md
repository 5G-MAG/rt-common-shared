# 5G_APIs overrides

The contents of this directory are used by the `../scripts/generate_openapi`
script to override OpenAPI YAML files from the
[5G_APIs](https://forge.3gpp.org/rep/all/5G_APIs) repository (automatically
cloned by the `generate_openapi` script).

This directory will normally be empty on the main branch of this repository as
we wish to use the original YAML files from 5G_APIs, but branches may be created
to provide experimental overrides of overrides for specific, in progress, CRs.
